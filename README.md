# todolist
Web-based to-do list. 

## Instructions
In order to use this to-do list application, a web server capable of interpreting php is needed (apache or nginx). For the purposes of this project, I used PHP's built-in web server to test my code locally. Additionally, a .env file must be created containing the password that enables the adding/completing/removing functionalities. Here's an example:

```
PASSWORD=$2y$10$ewR6yX6wGkjfcvVwCvFQTempmF8YFMW0JaoltfzM.iVtu7qrB62wW
```

## Motivation

I started this project during my service in the Korean army, where I only had access to diskless computers. The absence of a local storage inspired me to create a web-based to-do list that enables me to track deadlines and personal goals, even while using these diskless systems.
